## My process

1. plan
   2.design
   3.execute

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Although I am now familiar with specific tools such as Flexbox and Grid I constantly find myself researching simple things like how to import fonts or add a gradient on top of an image and I've realized that I will never stop learning, one valuable lesson from this simple project is the importance of planning my work before beginning to code as it will make it much simpler and will make my code “cleaner”.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on HTML and CSS to strengthen my skills and become more familiar with the languages, once I reach a certain level of confidence I will move to JavaScript.

### Useful resources

The following are some of the resources that I constantly use while working on projects and that I would definitely recommend.

- [Online HTML Viewer, HTML Beautifier, HTML Formatter, HTML Editor to Test output - Convert HTML Strings to a Friendly Readable Format, Beautify.](https://codebeautify.org/htmlviewer) - this helped me keep my code organized and easy to read.

- [CSS Formatter is an easy to use tool to Beautify CSS data. Copy, Paste, and Beautify. What can you do with CSS Beautifier? It helps to format your CSS.](https://codebeautify.org/css-beautify-minify) - this helped me keep my code organized and easy to read.
